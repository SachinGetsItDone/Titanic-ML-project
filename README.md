## 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application built on the classic Titanic dataset, covering everything from data analysis to model deployment.

The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, class, fare, etc.





## 📌 Project Overview

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the data

Preprocessed data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Built a Logistic Regression classification model

Evaluated the model using a validation set

Saved the trained model using pickle

Created a Flask API for predictions

Deployed the API using Render

Managed code with Git & GitHub
